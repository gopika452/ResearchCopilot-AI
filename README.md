\# ResearchCopilot-AI

AI-powered research and financial document analysis platform using OCR, LLMs, and Knowledge Graphs.



\## Overview

ResearchCopilot-AI automates analysis of financial and research documents that are usually manual, time-consuming, and error-prone.

The system extracts structured information from PDFs, answers natural-language questions, and organizes insights for explainable decision-making.



\## Key Features

\- OCR-based text extraction from scanned PDFs

\- LLM-powered question answering

\- Financial document understanding

\- Multi-model evaluation (Azure OCR, HuggingFace, Ollama, LLaMA)

\- Knowledge Graph–ready structured outputs

\- Backend API with FastAPI

\- Frontend UI built with React + Vite
